# Github Ur (Gur)

A command-line utility to easily manage
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
repositories censorable Github HTTP mirrors.

The program depends on the
[Crash Bash](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-bash)
library,
the
[GitHub command-line utility](
  https://github.com/cli/cli)
and the
[PyGitHub](
  https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub)
Python library.

## Installation

The program in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

#### Valid when I wake up later today

The Gur has been officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`gur`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  gur
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[gur-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/gur-ur).

Be aware the mirror could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
